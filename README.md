# micro-Framework NetGrad
the purpose of this Project is building **Neural Network** based on mathematic prespective without inculde any addittional Top-Built frameworkes such Tensorflow or Pytorch , the main idea here is get hands-on mathematic behind NN :

1. the topics covers :

   - the main components of NN Modeling :
     * dimension Space and vector 
     * vector operations  
     * learnble weights matrix 
     * Bais
     * activation function 

```
       Neural Networks are Non-linear function makes mechanism learning be effeciency to find relations patterns in Dimenssion Space 
``` 

   - how does NN handle Backward/Forward 
     - Backprobagation algorithm 
     - Graph algorithms ** Topology sorting**

   - how to training NN
     * Obejective functions Optimization
       - newton Gaussain method **Numerical analysis methods**
   - how to meaure the performence NN 
     - Loss Function 

2. Web application :
we will develope a web application to simulate some of problems such Classfication and regression '

   1. first Problem :
      Classfiy images digit-recognition using built NN based on our micro-Framework 
   2. second problem : 
      predict the price house from Data to find relation and colloration Variables
