# micro-Framework NetGrad
the purpose of this Project is building **Neural Network** based on mathematic prespective without inculde any addittional Top-Built frameworkes such Tensorflow or Pytorch , the main idea here is get hands-on mathematic behind NN :

1. the topics covers :

   - the main components of NN Modeling :
     * input vector 
     * learnble weights matrix 
     * Bais 
     * activation function 

       ```
       Neural Networks are Non-linear function makes mechanism learning be effeciency to find relations patterns in Dimenssion Space 
       ``` 

   - how does NN handle input of data in vectors 
   - how to training NN 
     * Optimization  
   - how to meaure the performence NN 
     - Loss Function
